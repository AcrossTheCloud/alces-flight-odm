# alces-flight-odm
Example of how to use [Alces Flight](https://alces-flight.com/) for [OpenDroneMap](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/OpenDroneMap) jobs.

## Usage
* Install the docker feature (either at launch)
* The [odm_runner.sh](odm_runner.sh) script takes a single parameter, the name of a subdirectory (which in turn must contain an images/ subdirectory) and submits a job to the (slurm) queuing system.
